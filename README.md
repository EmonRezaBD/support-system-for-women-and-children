# Work:
1. Create a frontend
2. Connect the frontend with the database, all tables should be created beforehand
# Look my codes for more information. 
    I use bootstrap for frontend.
    Raw php for backend.
    No framework is used(ex. React, Laravel) here. This is a simple and small scale project which can be implemented within short time.
